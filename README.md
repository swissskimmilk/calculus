# Calculus: a Collection of Useful Python Scripts
### All programs work on the TI-Nspire CX II
## trap.py 
Computes the integral of an equation using the trapezoidal method. Requires the upper and lower bounds, equation, and number of steps. 
## trapT.py
Computes the integral of a table of y values using the trapezoidal method. Requires the upper and lower bounds, table, and constant step size. 
## simp.py
Computes the integral of an equation using Simpson's rule. Requires the upper and lower bounds, equation, and number of steps.  
## simpT.py
Computes the integral of a table of y values using Simpson's method. Requires the upper bound and lower bounds, table, and constant step size. 
## eulersmethod.py
Creates a table of tables, showing Euler's method. Requires the step size, the number of steps, an initial point, and the equation for dy/dx.
## newtonsmethod.py
Creates a table of tables showing Newton's Method. Requires the function, the derivative of the function, and the initial x-value. Maximum number of iterations and epsilon is hard coded.
