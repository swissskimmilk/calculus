### All programs work on the TI-Nspire CX II
## trap.py 
Computes the integral of an equation using the trapezoidal method. Requires the upper and lower bounds, equation, and number of steps. 
## trapT.py
Computes the integral of a table of y values using the trapezoidal method. Requires an upper bound, lower bound, table, and a constant step size. 
## simp.py
Computes the integral of an equation using Simpson's rule. Requires the upper and lower bounds, equation, and number of steps.  
## eulers method.py
Creates a table of tables, showing euler's method. Requires the step size, number of steps, y(0) and the equation for dy/dx. It currentlyy only works with y(0) as the given.
